# ENIAC Simulator

This is a pulse-level simulator of the ENIAC.
The current state of the simulator covers all
of the functionality as originally constructed
at the University of Pennsylvania.
Future plans include implementing the enhancements
that were made at the Ballistics Research Lab
during its operational life.

The simulator is discussed in some detail in
[Simulating the ENIAC](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8326772/).
